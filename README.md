# Angular15 MUI Essentials

- **Standalone Components** are a simplified Way to build Angular Applications
- Standalone Components, Directives and Pipes aim to streamline the Programming Experience by Reducing the Need for `NgModule`
- Standalone Components are not registered in a Module
- They contain their needed Imports

## Key Features

- Angular supports Two-Way Data Binding, that automatically updates the View when the Model changes and vice versa
- A Result of Two-Way Data Binding is that it eliminates the Need to manually update the Display as the Model changes, making enormous Volumes of Data easier to handle and manipulate
- Angular provides a built-in Routing System that allows Developers to define the different States of an Application and map them to specific URLs
  A Result of Routing System is that it makes it easy to create SPAs with multiple Views and a dynamic User Interface
- Angular provides a powerful Dependency Injection System
- The Dependency Injection System allows Developers to manage the Dependencies between different Parts of the Application easily and Anngular is responsible for creating, managing, and providing a Dependencies of Components to the Functions
- Angular supports Reactivity that allows automatic Updates in the Application when Data changes, thus eliminating the Need for Boilerplate Code
- Angular has a powerful Template Language, which makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive User Interfaces
